# Kickstarter-Analysis-1
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Overview of Project
*Helping an Indivitual who wants to open their Kickstarter
### Purpose
*The person needs a tayored analysis, so there can be better success in their Kickstarter Campaign. Data was collected from database to be filtered to fit the Kickstarters needs such as Location, Plays, Goals, & Timing. Finally two charts were made to show more favorable months to start a kickstarter, and the Goals that carry higher success rate.

## Analysis and Challenges
*Analysis came with a few struggles that presented itself such as roadblocks, finding a solution to make a functions carry its duty correctly, also Charts carried its difficulty but, mostly from my part for choosing pivot chart instead of the traditional line graph button, and at the end its clear its not the most asthetic, but can correctly convey the analysis.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
*Possibilites were charted using (x=Months,Y=Percentage)
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
*Ranges were charted by using (x=Goals,Y=Percentage)
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
*Outcomes Based on Goals, main issue found was an adequate chart to fit the data
*Outcomes Based on Launch Date, difficulty was found in the structuring & adequate fields to fit Filters, Columns, Rows, & Values.
## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
 *The perferred months are January-October, but the best months would be April-July.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
 *The perferred range is 0-12.5k & 32.5K-41.2k, but the best range is 0-5k & 35k-40k.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
 *Analysis was not done to the content of the plays we are examining, which has potential to limit this analysis.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
 *Examinaton of the contents of these Kickstarter plays, shown in a bar graph with themes to find correlation, & provide deeper analysis.
